## Introduction
This project involves creating an ETL pipeline for extracting data from the REDFIN website, performing data transformations and cleaning, and loading the transformed data into Snowflake. The data is then visualized using Power BI to generate insights and dashboards. The entire process is automated using Apache Airflow, leveraging Amazon EC2, Python, SQL, and Airflow.

## Features
- Data extraction from REDFIN site.
- Data transformation and cleaning.
- Data loading into Snowflake.
- Data visualization using Power BI.
- Automation using Apache Airflow.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Apache Airflow
- Snowflake account
- Power BI
- Amazon EC2 instance

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/redfin-etl-pipeline.git
   cd redfin-etl-pipeline
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure Airflow:
   ```bash
   export AIRFLOW_HOME=~/airflow
   airflow db init
   airflow users create --username admin --firstname FIRST_NAME --lastname LAST_NAME --role Admin --email YOUR_EMAIL
   ```

4. Set up AWS credentials and Snowflake connection details in Airflow.

5. Start Airflow:
   ```bash
   airflow webserver -p 8080
   airflow scheduler
   ```

## Usage
1. Trigger the DAG from the Airflow web interface to start the ETL process.
2. Monitor the ETL pipeline execution in the Airflow web interface.
3. Access the transformed data in Snowflake.
4. Connect Power BI to Snowflake to generate dashboards and insights.
